        <h3> What are Tarot Cards? </h3>
        <br><br>
        <p> Tarot cards are a centuries-old form of divination and guidance. A tarot deck consists of 78 cards, each with its unique symbolism 
            and meaning. Tarot readings are used to gain insights into various aspects of life, including love, career, and personal development.
             In a typical reading, a reader draws a set number of cards and interprets their symbolism to provide guidance and answers to your 
             questions. Tarot readings can be a powerful tool for introspection and seeking guidance when faced with life's uncertainties.
